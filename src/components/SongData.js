    lyric: `2 a.m. and the rain is falling
Here we are at the crossroads once again
You're telling me you're so confused
You can't make up your mind
Is this meant to be
You're asking me

But only love can say - try again or walk away
But i believe for you and me
The sun will shine one day
So i'll just play my part
And pray you'll have a change of heart
But i can't make you see it through
That's something only love can do

In your arms as the dawn is breaking
Face to face and a thousand miles apart
I've tried my best to make you see
There's hope beyond the pain
If we give enough, if we learn to trust

Chorus

I know if i could find the words
To touch you deep inside
You'd give our dream just one more chance
Don't let this be our last good-bye
